## Review of Web Portfolio ##
This time, I created my first website for my web portfolio. I had never done responsive web design before, so it was difficult to grasp the overall structure, and I ran into obstacles many times. Even during this task, Grid, and Flex did not work well and it took time to solve the problem. However, on the other hand, I felt that I could understand more than before by proceeding while investigating what I did not understand. I feel like I've finally made it to the starting line of this work. I still have a lot to learn, but I have begun to feel the joy of understanding each one. After completing this task, I would like to further improve my skills.
