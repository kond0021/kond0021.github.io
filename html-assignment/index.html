            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Tatsu, and I am studying in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>
                program at Algonquin College. I'm from the city of <em>Pokemon</em> in Japan. So, when I was a kid, I
                was crazy about <em>Pokemon</em> games. Now I've been really into taking pictures. Likewise, I like wild
                squirrels when shooting in Canada, for their bouncing movement is so cute and feels like a real <em>Pokemon</em>.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, my future goal is to be a <strong>worldwide creator</strong> who can generate what everyone
                knows about like <em>Pokemon</em>. To that end, I think that the most important issues are to obtain a free and creative
                work style as a short-term goal and to create an environment where I can freely create what I want to make
                independently as a creator.
